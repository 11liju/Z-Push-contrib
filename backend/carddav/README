This is a CardDAV backend based in the vcarddir backend.

It supports DAViCal, Sogo and SabreDav... and should works with any carddav server.

It supports ChangesSink method that will detect and send faster changes to your device.

DAViCal implements the SYNC operation, it's a very fast method to detect changes in your vcards.
The others servers don't implement it, so the code will fallback to a slower method (suggest your carddav server developers to implement it!!).

This is controlled with a flag in the config.php file.


REQUISITES:
php-curl
