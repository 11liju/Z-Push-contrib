Z-Push-contrib
==============

This is a Z-Push fork with changes that I will try to put into the contrib branch, so they can get into the official Z-Push

IMPORTANT:
For them to get into the official Z-Push, you must sign a developer agreement with Zarafa (creators of Z-Push), and give them your rights over the code.

If you see some changes here, and you are the author, I will not contrib them, as I have no rights over them.
But I will try to reimplement with different code/approach so I can contribute them. When a sustitution is ready I will remove your changes from this repo.
If you want to help the community, contribute them yourself.


IMPORTANT 2:
All the code is AGPL licensed (or compatible, like the "include" files). So you can get a copy, modify it, use... your only obligation it's to publish your changes somewhere.
